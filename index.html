	<p>A horse walks into a bar. The bartender asks the horse if it's an alcoholic considering all the bars he frequents, to which the horse replies "I think not!"</p>
	<p>POOF! The horse disappears.</p>
	<p>This is the point in time when all the philosophy students in the audience begin to giggle, as they are familiar with the philosophical proposition of Cogito ergo sum, or I think, therefore, I am.</p>
	<p>But to explain the concept aforehand would be putting Descartes before the horse.</p>
